# Idle Rummy (working title)

An idle game built around making high scoring rummy melds.

### Where to play

Right now you need to build the react project yourself by cloning this repo. I'll get a github sites set up once it's in a vaguely working state.

### Todo List
 * Playable Game
   * [ ] You can get points by scoring hands
   * [ ] Deck cooldown
   * [ ] Upgrades are purchasable (and like 2 upgrades)
   * [ ] Upgrades are displayed nicely
   * [ ] Locked upgrades are hidden/greyed out
   * [ ] Publish to a site
 * Pre-automation
   * [ ] All hand multiplier upgrades
   * [ ] All handsize increase upgrades
   * [ ] All timer decrease upgrades
   * [ ] Golden cards (probably have an upgrade to unlock them)
   * [ ] Playtest and balance
 * Visual upgrades
   * [ ] Backgrounds
   * [ ] Upgrade Icons
   * [ ] Better looking cards?
   * [ ] Card dealing animations?
   * [ ] Card scoring animations
 * Automation
 * Everything else

### Point Brainstorming
Idk where to put this so I'm just tossing it in the readme
I want to get some stats on how common each hand type is for 5, 7 and 10 cards
